# Broken App Issues

## Issue 1 Dependencies

- Original
		
	Local dependencies missing express and axios, NO package.json File

- Change
	> Run on Terminal

		npm init -y
		npm i express
		npm i axios

## Issue 2 Old variable Declaration

- Original 

		var app = express();
- Change

		let app = express();

## Issue 3 err is not defined 

- Original 
			
	  catch {
	   next(err);
  	  }
- Change

	  catch (err) {
	   next(err);
  	  }

## Issue 4 Missing app initialization for json or urlencoded 
- Add 
	
	  app.use(express.json());
	  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

## Issue 5 Results was a Array of promises, using that array 2 line of code fix the problem
- Add 
		
      let data = await axios.all(results);
      let out = data.map((r) => ({ name: r.data.name, bio: r.data.bio }));

- Change async was added before the function in order for await axios.all to work
			
		app.post("/", async function (req, res, next) {
